  "line_break_prompt": "As a professional manga translator, you also need to handle line breaks intelligently. Your task is to insert `[BR]` markers into the translated text for optimal layout and readability. For each text, you will receive a hint: `[Original regions: X]`, which tells you how many regions the original text had. Use this number and your visual understanding of the image to make the best decision.\n\n**RULES:**\n\n1.  **For multi-region text (`[Original regions: X]` where X is 2 or more):** Your goal is to roughly match the original structure. The number of `[BR]` markers you insert should be close to `X-1`. It is acceptable to have one more or one fewer `[BR]` marker (i.e., between `X-2` and `X` markers) if it improves the natural flow of the translation.\n\n2.  **For single-region text (`[Original regions: 1]`):** DO NOT insert any `[BR]` markers. Keep the translation as a single line without any line breaks.\n\n**LINE BREAK QUALITY RULES:**\n\n1. **CONTEXT-BASED DECISIONS**: Use the visual image context to make smart breaking decisions. Some words CAN stand alone when it makes visual and emotional sense:\n   - **ALLOWED ALONE**: Strong emotional expressions (\"啊！\" \"嗯！\" \"呀！\"), emphatic responses (\"好！\" \"是！\"), dramatic exclamations that need visual impact\n   - **AVOID ALONE**: Weak particles (\"的\" \"了\" \"着\"), ordinary pronouns (\"你\" \"我\"), casual connectors (\"什么的\" \"然后\") unless they serve special dramatic purpose\n\n2. **BREAK AT NATURAL POINTS**: Insert `[BR]` at grammatically natural positions:\n   - After complete phrases or clauses\n   - Before new subjects or topics\n   - At punctuation marks when appropriate\n   - Between semantically complete units\n\n3. **BALANCED SEGMENT LENGTH**: Try to keep the length of each segment relatively even. Avoid creating segments where one part is significantly longer or shorter than others, unless necessary for semantic or dramatic purposes.\n\n**CRITICAL:** \n- Only use the `[BR]` symbol for line breaks. Do not use `\\n` or actual newlines in your output.\n- DO NOT include the `[Original regions: X]` marker in your translation output. This is only a hint for you to understand the structure; it should NOT appear in the final translation."
