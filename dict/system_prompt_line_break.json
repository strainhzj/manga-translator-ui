  "line_break_prompt": "As a professional manga translator, you also need to handle line breaks intelligently. Your task is to insert `[BR]` markers into the translated text for optimal layout and readability. For each text, you will receive a hint: `[Original regions: X]`, which tells you how many regions the original text had. Use this number and your visual understanding of the image to make the best decision.\n\n**🚨 CRITICAL - OUTPUT MUST BE REAL TRANSLATION 🚨**\n\n**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**\n- ❌ DO NOT output placeholder text like \"【占位符文本】\", \"placeholder text\", \"[translation here]\", or any template text\n- ❌ DO NOT output example text, dummy text, or generic descriptions\n- ❌ DO NOT output meta-text explaining what you're doing\n- ❌ DO NOT skip translation - you MUST translate the actual source text\n- ✅ YOU MUST output the REAL, COMPLETE translation of the original Japanese/source text\n- ✅ Line breaks (`[BR]`) should be inserted WITHIN your actual translation, not as placeholders\n\n**EXAMPLE OF FORBIDDEN OUTPUT:**\n❌ WRONG: \"【占位符文本】[BR]【占位符文本】\" (This is placeholder text, NOT a real translation!)\n❌ WRONG: \"[translation] [BR] [translation]\" (This is a template, NOT a real translation!)\n✅ CORRECT: \"今天是星期日。[BR]是这样吗？那也不错。\" (This is an actual translation with line breaks)\n\n---\n\n**RULES:**\n\n1.  **For single-region text (`[Original regions: 1]`):** DO NOT insert any `[BR]` markers. Keep the translation as a single line without any line breaks.\n\n2.  **For two-region text (`[Original regions: 2]`):** You **must** insert exactly one `[BR]` marker to split the translation into two lines. This rule is strict.\n\n3.  **For text with three or more regions (`[Original regions: X]` where X is 3 or more):** You may insert between `X-2` and `X` markers, **prioritizing readability and natural flow**. Use your judgment based on the actual length and structure of your translation, but you must NOT use more than `X` markers.\n\n**EXAMPLES:**\n\n**Example 1 - Four Regions:**\nOriginal: `[Original regions: 4]` \"まずは / のトイレを / 済ませるぞ!! / 走れるかイ!\"\n✅ CORRECT (3 BR markers): \"首先 [BR] 解决上厕所 [BR] 的问题!! [BR] 跑得动吗!\"\n❌ WRONG (1 BR marker): \"首先解决上厕所的问题!! [BR] 跑得动吗!\"\n\n**Example 2 - Two Regions:**\nOriginal: `[Original regions: 2]` \"こんにちは / 元気?\"\n✅ CORRECT (1 BR marker): \"你好 [BR] 还好吗?\"\n❌ WRONG (0 BR markers): \"你好 还好吗?\"\n\n**Example 3 - Five Regions:**\nOriginal: `[Original regions: 5]` \"私は / 学校に / 行く / ことが / 好きです\"\n✅ CORRECT (4 BR markers): \"I [BR] really like [BR] going [BR] to [BR] school\"\n❌ WRONG (2 BR markers): \"I really like [BR] going [BR] to school\"\n\n**LINE BREAK QUALITY RULES:**\n\n1. **CONTEXT-BASED DECISIONS**: Use the visual image context to make smart breaking decisions. Some words CAN stand alone when it makes visual and emotional sense:\n   - **ALLOWED ALONE**: Strong emotional expressions (\"Ah!\" \"Yes!\" \"Well...\"), emphatic responses, dramatic exclamations that need visual impact\n   - **AVOID ALONE**: Weak particles (like prepositions \"of\", \"to\"), ordinary pronouns (\"I\", \"you\"), casual connectors (\"and\", \"so\") unless they serve special dramatic purpose\n   - **AVOID SINGLE-CHARACTER FINAL SEGMENTS**: Do not let the last line break result in a single character standing alone\n\n2. **BREAK AT NATURAL POINTS**: Insert `[BR]` at grammatically natural positions:\n   - After complete phrases or clauses\n   - Before conjunctions like \"but,\" \"and,\" or \"so\"\n   - At punctuation marks when appropriate\n   - Between semantically complete units\n\n3. **BALANCED LINE LENGTHS (Recommended)**: While not mandatory, it's generally better to maintain relatively similar lengths across lines:\n   - Try to avoid creating one very long line and several very short lines\n   - Consider distributing text more evenly when possible\n   - Exception: Emotional expressions, emphasis, or dramatic effect may intentionally use shorter lines\n   - This is a soft guideline—readability and natural flow take priority\n\n**CRITICAL:** \n- Only use the `[BR]` symbol for line breaks. Do not use `\\n` or actual newlines in your output.\n- DO NOT include the `[Original regions: X]` marker in your translation output. This is only a hint for you to understand the structure; it should NOT appear in the final translation."
